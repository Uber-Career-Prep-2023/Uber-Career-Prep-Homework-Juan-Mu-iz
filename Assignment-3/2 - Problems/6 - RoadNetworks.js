// Question 6: RoadNetworks

///// Problem explanation ///// 
// In some states, it is not possible to drive between any two towns because they are not connected to the same road network. Given a list of towns and a list of pairs representing roads between towns, return the number of road networks. (For example, a state in which all towns are connected by roads has 1 road network, and a state in which none of the towns are connected by roads has 0 road networks.)

///// Examples /////
// Input: ["Skagway", "Juneau", "Gustavus", "Homer", "Port Alsworth", "Glacier Bay", "Fairbanks", "McCarthy", "Copper Center", "Healy"], 
// [("Anchorage", "Homer"), ("Glacier Bay", "Gustavus"), ("Copper Center", "McCarthy"), ("Anchorage", "Copper Center"), ("Copper Center", "Fairbanks"), ("Healy", "Fairbanks"), ("Healy", "Anchorage")]

// Output: 2 (Networks are Gustavus-Glacier Bay and Anchorage-Fairbanks-McCarthy-Copper Center-Homer-Healy)

// Input: ["Kona", "Hilo", "Volcano", "Lahaina", "Hana", "Haiku", "Kahului", "Princeville", "Lihue", "Waimea"], [("Kona", "Volcano"), ("Volcano", "Hilo") ("Lahaina", "Hana"), ("Kahului", "Haiku"), ("Hana", "Haiku"), ("Kahului", Lahaina"), ("Princeville", "Lihue"), ("Lihue", "Waimea")]

// Output: 2 (Networks are Kona-Hilo-Volcano, Haiku-Kahului-Lahaina-Hana, and Lihue-Waimea-Princeville)
